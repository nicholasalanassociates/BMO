QA Engineer Technical Test
JUST EAT has a website available at http://www.just-eat.co.uk/ that you can use to find takeaway restaurants in a postcode area.
The Technical test consists of 2 tasks:
Write the step definitions for the below scenario.
 Feature: Use the website to find restaurants
          So that I can order food
          As a hungry customer
           I want to be able to find restaurants in my area
  Scenario: Search for restaurants in an area
          Given I want food in "AR51 1AA"
          When I search for restaurants
          Then I should see some restaurants in "AR51 1AA"
Add two more scenarios, with corresponding step definitions, which you feel would enhance the test coverage of the site.
Platform Choice
You can create step definitions using any language of framework you are experienced with
Task requirements
Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met.
Please complete the two tasks described above.
You should provide clear instructions on your test setup and how to execute your tests. The clarity and precision of these instructions - and the ease with which the interviewers can execute them - will be a key part of the assessment. Please create a README file detailing said instructions. Please also use this file for listing any additional comments or observations you might want to share about your submission.
Technical questions
Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called Answers to technical questions.md.
How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
